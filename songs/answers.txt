- If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

ANSWER:

If the aura is determined by the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person, we should use the following query:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

- Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

ANSWER:

The way I've calculated the aura, using simple averages for energy, valence, and danceability, might not be very representative of the listener because the list likely includes songs that were
only barely listened to or weren't favorites. These "edge" values, or outliers, can distort the overall averages, making the aura less reflective of the listener's true musical preferences.

A better aproach to the problem would be narrowing the list to the top 50 songs.
