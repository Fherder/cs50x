                I played this game for the first time with my father when i was 10 years old, I remember beating it in two days and having a lot of fun with my dad. After turning 16 my
                father gifted me the remaster version of the game for the PS4 and it struck me like a truck, after beating the game again after all those years I realized... That game is one of
                the best games i ever played.
