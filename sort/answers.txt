sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It's faster than sort3 when sorting sorted text files due to the big omega running time ( O(n) )

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It's the fastest of the three algorithms due to the running time being O(n * log(n))

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It's slower than sort1 when sorting sorted text files, due to the running time O(n^2)
